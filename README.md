DigitNet: Handwritten Digit Classification and Recognition using Keras API within TensorFlow Framework

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and save models using both the Sequential and Functional APIs in TensorFlow/Keras.

Features
-Data Preprocessing: MNIST dataset loading, reshaping, and normalization.
-Model Architectures: Implementation of CNN using both Sequential and Functional APIs.
-Model Training: Training with validation, using dropout for regularization.
-Model Saving/Loading: Save the trained model in Keras's native format and reload it for evaluation.
-Performance Evaluation: Confusion matrix and classification report for model assessment.
-Visualization: Displaying sample test images with their predicted labels.
